# About


## Professional

I am currently a second-year doctoral student at the [Leiden University Centre for Linguistics (LUCL)](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities/leiden-university-centre-for-linguistics) in the Netherlands.

I obtained my BA in English from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/) and my MA in Linguistics and Applied Linguistics from [Guangdong University of Foreign Studies](https://english.gdufs.edu.cn/).

My research looks at issues in Chinese syntax within the generative framework, with a particular focus on phenomena related to the clausal periphery (e.g., sentence-final particles).

## Personal

My Chinese name is pronounced as \[ʋei35 y214 jɑŋ35\]. You can also call me Isaac.
